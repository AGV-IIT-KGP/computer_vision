Computer Vision Class 1
=======================
This tutorial is for the people who are complete beginners in the area of
computer vision and image processing also aren't very familiar with numpy and
other tools in python. It intends to give a good balance between the practical
and the theoretical aspects of the area. I expect to finish the tutorial within
2 hours.

What is an Image?
-----------------
(10 minutes)

* The matrix view
* The samples of a function view
* Color spaces

Using Python tools for image analysis and manipulation
------------------------------------------------------


### Prerequisites

* Anaconda Package for the latest Python 2.x . That should include
  the python interpretor, IPython, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Anaconda can be
  downloaded from Continuum's website. [Download Link](http://continuum.io/downloads)
* Python imaging library(PIL). (NOTE: PIL is not supported for Python 3.x)
  PIL can be installed with `conda` (installed with anaconda) using
  command `conda install pil`
* Very basic familiarity with Python: That can be gained from spending an hour or
  two on [code academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python).


### Basic numpy operations
(20 minutes)

* Indexing
* Slicing
* Point wise operations
* Operations on regions
* Exercise 1:

### Image Analysis
(40 minutes)

* Loading an image
* Displaying an image
* Manipulating Pixels
* More manipulation of Pixels
* Exercise 2: The red, blue and green image from the given colored image
  (teaches about the color space in the RBG image and manipulating them)
* Exercise 3: Write an H on the image
  (teaches similar things as above)
* Homework 1: Staining the image

### Maplotlib and Histograms
(20 minutes)

* Basic 2D plotting with Matplotlib, (ploting sin(x))
* Exercise 4: plot `cos(x)*cos(x)`
* Parametric Plotting: plotting a parabola with axis parallel to x axis
* Exercise 5: plot a circle
* What are histograms
* Plotting a histogram
* Exercise: plotting a histogram of colored image
* Linear stretching of histogram
* Histogram equalization
* Homework 2:

## Questions and buffer time
(30 minutes)
