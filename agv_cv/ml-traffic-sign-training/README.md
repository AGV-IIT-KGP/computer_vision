# ml-traffic-sign-training

This repository contains python codes for training traffic signs from "The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" dataset.

Multiple methods are used to train on a dataset present in the file "dataset.mat"

  - nn_train.py : custom three layered neural network using back-propagation as taught in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course.
  - tensorflow1.py : training based on the "MNIST For ML Beginners", TensorFlow tutorial.
  - tensorflow2.py : training based on the "Deep MNIST for Experts", TensorFlow tutorial.


The "dataset.mat" file contains X(a X b) and Y(a X 1) matrices. 
  - X: = input data. 
  - Y = class the input data belongs to.   
  - a = number of input data. 
  - b = total number of pixels in each data)

The "dataset.mat" file is generated by the following files from a directory of input images of the German Dataset.
  - create_dataset.py: simply generate the dataset file from the grayscale input images.
  - create_processed_dataset.py: generate the dataset file from the grayscale input images after processing to highlight the most important features of the images for training.
