Computer Vision
===============
![Build_status](https://travis-ci.org/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision.svg?branch=master) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision)  

This is the computer vision stack for the Team [AGV-IIT-KGP](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/).
Currently we are in the learning phase and are trying to implement the
algorithms of the book **Feature Extraction and Image Processing**. All our
work takes place through GitHub [Pull Requests](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision/pulls).
You can find the list of relevant resources at [Awesome Computer Vision](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/awesome-computer-vision)
And if you want to ask questions then we have a public chat room at gitter.

If you are a IIT-KGP student and you are interested in working with us. Then go
though the IPython Notebook `Tutorial 1.ipynb` and then get in touch with us
through email at gupta.harsh96 AT gmail DOT com.

Using the Tutorial
------------------

The tutorial is a IPython Notebook. IPython Notebooks are interactive
computational enviornments with formatted text intructions and executable code
cells.

* **Install the IPython**: It can be very easily installed through the anaconda
  package available at the [continuum Analytics web site](http://continuum.io/downloads).

* Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision.git`

* Open the Tutorial
`ipython notebook Tutorial\ 1.ipynb &`

You can also view the Tutorial online at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/AGV-IIT-KGP/computer_vision/blob/master/Tutorial%201.ipynb),
though the code cells at nbviewer won't be executable.
